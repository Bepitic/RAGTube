# RAGTube

## Overview
RAGTube is an open-source project developed by Paco that transforms YouTube video content into a structured knowledge base optimized for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) models. This tool automates the extraction of video metadata, descriptions, and transcripts, compiling them into a format that enriches small language models with precise, context-rich information tailored for specific tasks.

## Features
- **Automated Video Data Extraction**: Efficiently pulls metadata, descriptions, and transcripts from YouTube.
- **Dockerized Application Architecture**: Utilizes separate Docker containers for scraping YouTube data and for managing the RAG.
- **Scalable and Customizable**: Designed to handle large datasets and adaptable to specific user needs.
- **Seamless RAG Integration**: Provides structured data ready to be utilized by RAG models for improved data retrieval.

## Getting Started
RAGTube is containerized in Docker to simplify deployment and ensure consistency across different environments. Here's how to get it running:

### Prerequisites
- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Installation and Usage
Detailed instructions on setting up and using RAGTube are available in the `/docs` directory. These documents provide comprehensive guidelines on deploying Docker containers, configuring the system, and executing the scripts within the Dockerized environment.
